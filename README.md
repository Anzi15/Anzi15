## A frontend web developer and a content creator

I enjoy crafting visually appealing layouts, websites, and web apps with practical features. 

I bring considerable experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the table, additionally I have good grip of css frameworks like bootstrap and tailwinds, and SCSS (which i prefer in most of my projects), My role extends beyond coding â€“ it involves understanding user's requirements, 
implementing effective solutions, and delivering projects that not only meet but exceed expectations.
